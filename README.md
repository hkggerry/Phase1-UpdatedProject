# Name
Magarita Express - a website that provides customers a convenient way to order drinks to their doorstep.

# Description
Given the limited varieties of APIs I have found online, I was able to start my project as an online margarita bar. 

Customers can easily place orders for our 3 featuring margaritas online. Wesbite not only features ingredient lists for each drinks, but also a hidden button that applies generous discounts upon clicking it.  

# Project Requirements
3 Separate Event Listeners:
- "Click" - Order Button
    function button()

- "MouseDown" - Picture
    renderDrinks(drinks)


- "Dblclick" - Margarita Emoji
    function hiddenDiscount()

Interactivity:
When Order button is clicked, "Order received" texts appear 
    

# Dependencies
- Big Sur macOS
- Windows 10
